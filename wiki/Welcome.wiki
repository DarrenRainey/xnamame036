This is the XnaMame 036 project, a port of the MAME v0.36 to XNA/C#

= Introduction =
The aim of this project was to check if MAME could be ported to C#/XNA so that I could run Pacman. Silly, I know; but it seems to run ok.

This that was an success, I wanted to implement the drivers for the games that I remember playing as a kid.

Sound is an issue at the moment, but I'm working on it. Not all implemented games have proper joystick/gamepad controls mapped - yet.

= Details =

The following drivers/games are implemented for now and seems to work ok.
