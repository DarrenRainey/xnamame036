Just for fun, I wanted to see if I could port enough of MAME to XNA to run Pacman. Eventually; I'd like to see this deployed to the XBOX also, since it uses no native code, just pure C#/XNA. There is support for zipped archives to save space, and joystick/gamepad. It now even has sound, although playback of samples is just static right now. Anybody who wants to help in - just drop me a line !
Optimization, sound, graphics, drivers, cpu, front-end etc.
